## Introduction

JavaScript, being one of the most popular programming languages among developers, offers multiple ways to organize and share code between different files.

When working with modules, you might come across two common ways of exporting functionality: Default exports and Named exports.
Understanding the difference between these two methods is essential for effectively managing your codebase and making it more maintainable.

In this article, we will explore the differences between Default and Named exports in JavaScript, highlighting their use cases and best practices to help you choose the right approach for your projects.
